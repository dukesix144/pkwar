DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
/wizrooms/<yourname>/ - Your personal directory
/areas/<areaname>/ - Completed areas for gameplay

ROOM FILES:
Create rooms as individual .py files with a load() function:

```python
from lib.models.entity import Room, Exit, DescriptionItem
from lib.models.enums import ExitType

def load():
    return Room(
        name='unique_room_name',
        description="Room description here.",
        exits=[
            Exit(
                name='north',
                description='Exit description.',
                destination='target_room_name',
                exit_type=ExitType.PATH
            )
        ]
    )
```

COMMANDS:
- load <file> - Load your room file
- goto <room> - Teleport to a room
- trans <player> - Bring player to you
- dest <object> - Destroy an object
- clone <template> - Create an object
