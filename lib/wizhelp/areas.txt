=== Creating Areas Guide ===

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
Your areas should be organized under /lib/areas/<areaname>/

ROOM TYPES:
1. Standard Room - No money, basic room
   from lib.models.entity import Room
   
2. Random Room - Drops coins on first visit
   from lib.special_rooms import RandomRoom

CONNECTING TO BACKBONE:
The backbone has 40 rooms (backbone_1 through backbone_40).
Connect your area entrance to one of these rooms.

EXAMPLE AREA STRUCTURE:
/lib/areas/darkforest/
  entrance.py     - Area entrance (connects to backbone)
  path1.py        - Internal rooms
  path2.py        
  treasure.py     - RandomRoom with money
  boss_lair.py    - Standard room (no money)

BEST PRACTICES:
- Use unique room names: 'darkforest_entrance', 'darkforest_path1'
- Mix room types - not every room should have money
- Create interesting descriptions and examine items
- Test all exits work both ways
- Document your area with a README

LOADING YOUR AREA:
1. Create all room files
2. Use 'load areas/darkforest/entrance' to test
3. Make sure all exits connect properly
4. Submit to higher level implementors for review

Remember: Only RandomRoom drops coins. Use it sparingly!
