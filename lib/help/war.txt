Wars are the heart of PKMUD!

STARTING A WAR:
1. Be a ghost in the warroom
2. Have 'war on' enabled
3. Push the button (need 2+ players with war on)
4. 60 second countdown begins

WAR TYPES:
- FFA: Free for all, last player alive wins
- Team: Two teams battle it out
- BvR: Best vs Rest (enforcers vs players)

DURING WAR:
- You spawn randomly on the backbone
- Kill other players to win
- First kill gets Spirit of Gerkin (yellow *)

CLASSES (Team/BvR only):
- Fighter: 1.5x HP, no SP
- Kamikaze: 3x damage, explodes on death
- Mage: 1.5x SP, can gate and fireball
